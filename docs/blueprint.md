## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Warm terracotta (#E2725B) to evoke a sense of earthiness and spice, reflecting the ingredients of shawarma.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5E7DE), a very desaturated near-analog of the primary hue, creates a calm, inviting backdrop that complements the bolder primary.
- Accent color: Burnt orange (#D9673B) to draw attention to key actions and important information.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif which offers both a modern look, and some warmth.
- Use custom icons that represent sales, inventory, expenses, and reporting, styled with earthy tones and simple shapes.
- Employ a clear and intuitive layout with logically grouped information for easy navigation and data input.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience without distracting from core tasks.
